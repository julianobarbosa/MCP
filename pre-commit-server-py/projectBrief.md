# pre-commit for Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Project Overview

A Python-based MCP server that integrates with git pre-commit hooks to provide code quality checks and spell checking capabilities. This server enables automated validation of code changes before commits while leveraging the Model Context Protocol for enhanced functionality.

## Core Features

1. Pre-commit Hook Integration
   - Seamless integration with git pre-commit framework
   - MCP-based hook execution and reporting
   - Support for multiple validation types
   - Asynchronous execution for improved performance

2. Spell Check Management
   - Multi-language dictionary support
   - Custom dictionary management
   - Word addition and removal capabilities
   - Integration with cspell configuration
