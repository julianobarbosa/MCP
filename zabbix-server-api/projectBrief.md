# Zabbix Server API for Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Project Overview

Create a comprehensive MCP server implementation for Zabbix monitoring system integration, enabling AI-powered monitoring and management capabilities.

### Core Purpose
- Provide MCP-compatible interface to Zabbix monitoring system
- Enable AI systems to manage and monitor Zabbix infrastructure
- Automate monitoring tasks through standardized MCP tools

## Technical Specifications

### API Integration
1. Authentication
   - Support for Zabbix API token-based authentication
   - Secure credential management via environment variables
   - Session handling and token renewal

2. Core Entities
   - Hosts management (create, update, delete, query)
   - Items and triggers
   - Templates and host groups
   - Monitoring data retrieval
   - Event and alert management

3. Rate Limiting
   - Implementation of request throttling
   - Configurable rate limits
   - Queue management for bulk operations

### MCP Tools

1. Host Management
   ```typescript
   {
     name: "create_host",
     description: "Create a new host in Zabbix",
     inputSchema: {
       type: "object",
       properties: {
         host: { type: "string" },
         name: { type: "string" },
         interfaces: { type: "array" },
         groups: { type: "array" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Monitoring Tools
   - Get host status
   - Retrieve monitoring data
   - Manage triggers and alerts
   - Template operations

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Dependencies
- MCP SDK for server implementation
- Zabbix API client library
- Request handling and validation
- Error management system

### Security Considerations
- Secure credential storage
- API token management
- Request validation and sanitization
- Error handling without data exposure

### Performance Requirements
- Response time < 500ms for standard operations
- Support for concurrent requests
- Rate limiting to protect Zabbix server
- Efficient data caching where applicable

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Modular design for entity management
- Clear separation of MCP and Zabbix logic
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type definitions for all components

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all tools
- Integration tests with Zabbix API
- Performance benchmarking
- Security testing
