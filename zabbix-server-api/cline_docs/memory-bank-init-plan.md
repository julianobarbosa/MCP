# 🗃️ Memory Bank Initialization Plan

## ✅ Step 1: Create Memory Bank Files
We will create the following files inside the `zabbix-server-api/memory-bank/` directory:
- `activeContext.md`
- `productContext.md`
- `progress.md`
- `decisionLog.md`
- `systemPatterns.md`

## ✅ Step 2: Populate Files With Initial Content
Files will be initialized with default content including specific context summarized from the project's `projectBrief.md`.

### File Initialization Content Structure

## activeContext.md
```markdown
# Active Context (Initialized on 3/18/2025)

## Current Focus
- Initialize Memory Bank for zabbix-server-api.

## Recent Changes
- Memory Bank initialized with default and project-specific context.

## Open Questions/Issues
- None at initialization.
```

## productContext.md
```markdown
# Product Context (Initialized on 3/18/2025)

## Project Goal
- Maintain Project Context Across Sessions and Memory Resets for Consistent AI-Assisted Development.

## Key Features
- Persistence across Roo's internal memory resets
- Comprehensive and structured project knowledge base
- Architect, Code, and Ask mode structured workflows
- Enforcement of specific project workflows via `.clinerules`

## Overall Architecture
- Structured persistence pattern using Memory Bank files.
```

## progress.md
```markdown
# Progress (Initialized on 3/18/2025)

## Completed Tasks
- None at initialization.

## Current Tasks
- Initialize Memory Bank with project-specific context.

## Next Steps
- Regularly maintain Memory Bank with updates as project evolves.
```

## decisionLog.md
```markdown
# Decision Log (Initialized on 3/18/2025)

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Implementation Details |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| 3/18/2025 | Initialize Memory Bank | Ensure consistency of project context across memory resets | Initial content with context from project brief |
```

## systemPatterns.md
```markdown
# System Patterns (Initialized on 3/18/2025)

## Coding Patterns
- TBD based on future coding standards and patterns.

## Architectural Patterns
- Memory Bank Context Persistence Pattern:
  - A structured "long-term memory" repository ensuring critical information is persistent across sessions and resets.

## Testing Patterns
- Pending definition based on future test strategies.
```
